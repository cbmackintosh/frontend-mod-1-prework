## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

When faced with the challenges of mastering a new skillset, it may be easy to accept limitations. People with a fixed mindset might think that they don't have any natural programming acumen, I was not made for this sort of thing. By comparison, the growth mindset recognizes limitless potential. You can learn anything as long as you incorporate discipline, practice etc. "Hard work always beats natural talent when natural talent doesn't work hard."

In the video, Carmen also discussed the "myth of the brilliant programmer" and how that relates to imposter syndrome. That's a concept that I had never heard prior to Turing, but I've heard several instructors mention it so far. There's no such thing as a programmer who knows everything. Programmers collaborate to solve problems, they google their questions and participate actively in the community online.

There is no finish line in this industry. Graduating Turing is not a finish line. Getting my first developer job is not a finish line. Learning a new skill necessitates a perpetual growth mindset. Adapting to a tech industry that is constantly evolving necessitates a perpetual growth mindset. Always work hard and trust in your ability to achieve anything.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

When I was in college, my plan was to pursue a career in journalism. Because my school did not offer a journalism major, I kind of had to take things into my own hands. I got a job writing for the campus newspaper, I pursued relevant internships, I networked with the right people and ultimately was able to secure a journalism job a few months after graduating. Pretty much everything I know about journalism was self-taught and I think that experience instilled in me a growth mindset.

Kristin's two-part blog post mentioned the importance of setting SMART goals. That's a concept I'm very familiar with, and I do appreciate the importance of effective strategic goal setting. Regardless, it's something that I've always struggled to put into practice. I think I sometimes focus too much on lofty goals like learning to code, and I focus less on breaking up those bigger goals into smaller, shorter-term steps.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Any playlist on my Spotify account is likely in an array. The playlist is an array and the songs within it are elements. I can type in search terms to find specific songs in the playlist, which probably involves some kind of array method. I can also add or remove songs from the playlist which would also be executed by an array method. Sorting by date or name allows me to rearrange the numerical positioning of every element within the array etc.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods allow us to extract specific information from an array and/or make changes to the array. For example, we can use an array methods to add or remove elements from the array. We can also use an array method to determine an element's numerical position in the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops allow us to establish a process that must be applied repeatedly with incremental changes to certain variables or parameters. In the context of an array, we might use a loop to apply the same process or coding logic to every element within that array. For example, if I have an array of numbers a loop will allow me to multiply each of those numbers by 3 and then print each result. Or we can build conditionals into the loop to see which elements within the array fulfill certain characteristics and which ones do not (such as the voting exercise).

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

You're in line to get lunch at the cafeteria. One by one, each person in line gets saved the same meal. Some people say they like the meal, some people say they didn't like the meal. The same process was performed on each person, but with varying results.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

When I used the push method to add 'rasberry' and 'pomegranate' to my food array in arrays.js, the console printed the array with every element on a different line.

````
[
'apple',
'banana',
'orange',
'strawberry',
'rasberry',
'pomegranate',
'pear'
]
````

None of the other methods appeared to have this result. Why was the output array formatted this way? Is there any difference? Does it matter how you format your arrays? Any advantage to one way or another?
