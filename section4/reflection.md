## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I would say my workflow felt subtly different under the Pomodoro technique. At first the short breaks every half hour felt a little disruptive but I think it sets you up for success in the long run. I found that I didn't fatigue as quickly because I was periodically taking short breaks, so I was able to work effectively for longer. A half hour is also a very manageable amount of time to focus and be productive. You're not asking too much of yourself and its comforting to know that a little rest is never far off.

I think taking short 3-5 minute breaks is definitely something I should incorporate more into my work habits. It's easy to become so involved with a project that you lose track of time which isn't helpful when you're dealing with deadlines and trying to be time-efficient.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Determining the task for today was simple. I have to have Section 4 completed by the end of the day on Sunday in order to adhere to the deadlines I set in my small group on Slack. I found that the Pomodoro technique helped me stay aware of how long I'd spent on the entire section. Rather than looking at the clock suddenly and wondering where the day went, I have a more structured accounting of what I accomplished throughout the day and how long it took.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An array is simply a list of elements. An Object is a variable with multiple different attributes (or properties) each containing their own value and data type. The big difference between arrays and objects is that arrays require an index number to identify and modify specific elements. Whereas with objects we can access and modify those properties using strings.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
ARRAY
This is just an ordered list. The names of each student aren't paired with any additional data.

  * List of states and their capitals
OBJECT  
Here we are storing more than just a list of states. We're storing a list of states with an attribute that each one shares: a capital. Each state on the list must be stored with a specific corresponding capital. Therefore an object is appropriate.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
ARRAY
This is just a list of items. There is no additional data to be stored or collated.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
OBJECT
I think this would be an object because each Instagram account would be associated with a specific handle and probably a link of some kind

  * List of student names and their cohort
OBJECT
Each student is paired with a cohort designation. If it was just a list of students it would be an array, but because each student must be paired with a cohort value an object is more appropriate,

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
OBJECT
Each ingredient must be paired with a quantity required for the recipe.

  * All my favorite restaurants
ARRAY
This is just a list of locations. If it was a list of your favorite restaurants and their respective addresses and yelp ratings, then you would need an object.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

At my old sales job, we used Salesforce to assign leads and manage accounts. Each business lead would be an object with the following key-value pairs: contact name, business name, assigned rep, phone number, email address, lead status.

Methods would be used to modify those existing key value pairs. There would be a method to assign the lead to a specific sales rep, or to change the assignment from one rep to another. Another method would allow us to add or update contact details. Another method would update the lead status from Assigned to Outreach to Meetings etc.

A class would be used to create new leads as new potential clients sign up for accounts.


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I think I understand the material from this section fairly well, but I definitely need to revise it before Mod1. Certainly this section was more challenging than the previous three. I was a little confused by the exercise above, where I had to decide if a data set should be represented by an object or an array. Wouldn't they all be arrays? Some are just simple string arrays, but others appear to be arrays consisting of objects. What's the difference between an object and an object literal?
